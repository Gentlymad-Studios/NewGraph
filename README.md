A data oriented node graph solution for **Unity** powered by **UIToolkit (UIElements)**. This is based on the idea to visualize complex data structures as graph networks without having to modify already established data classes, except adding `[Node]`, `[Port]`, `[PortList]` and `[SerializeReference]` attributes to all classes that should show in the Graph View. 

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/Gentlymad-Studios/NewGraph/wiki) for installation & usage instructions.
